  <section class="section about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a Ph.D. candidate at Duke University, researching deep learning for medical image analysis. My work focuses on understanding and improving segmentation models using techniques like shape learning in CNNs, weak and noisy annotations, and model evaluation under real-world constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I value rigorous and theoretical research, I am particularly motivated by projects that intersect with practical challenges and can be applied in real-world, product-driven environments. I aim to work on solutions that address industry-relevant problems and contribute to the development of usable technologies.
